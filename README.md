## **⚠️ Disclaimer**

The code examples provided for the book *Artificial Intelligence with PHP* are intended for educational purposes only. These examples are designed to illustrate concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence and machine learning using PHP. **They are not suitable for production use and should not be deployed on live servers or systems that handle sensitive data.**

These examples have not been subjected to rigorous security testing and may contain vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, or other issues that could pose security risks if used in production environments. We strongly advise readers to thoroughly test and secure any implementation of the techniques demonstrated in this book before using them in real-world applications.
