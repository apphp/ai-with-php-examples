        Vectors are fundamental objects in linear algebra, representing quantities with both magnitude and direction. Unlike scalars, which are single
        numbers, vectors consist of ordered lists of numbers. They can be visualized as arrows in space, where the length of the arrow represents
        magnitude and its orientation represents direction.
        Vectors are crucial in many mathematical and real-world applications, from physics to computer graphics and machine learning. Key operations
        with vectors include addition, scalar multiplication, and dot products. Understanding vectors is essential for grasping more complex concepts
        in linear algebra, such as matrix operations and linear transformations.
