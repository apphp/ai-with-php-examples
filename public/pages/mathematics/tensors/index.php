        Tensors in linear algebra are mathematical objects that generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions.
        At their core, tensors are multilinear maps or multilinear functions. They can be understood as objects that remain invariant under coordinate
        transformations while representing physical or mathematical quantities. This invariance property makes them particularly powerful for
        describing physical laws and mathematical relationships that should remain consistent regardless of the chosen coordinate system.
