        In PHP it can be written as a class Vector with implementation of a set of vector operations.
        This class is a PHP implementation of vector operations commonly used in linear algebra and, by extension, in various AI and machine learning
        algorithms. It provides a robust set of methods for performing vectors calculations, making it a valuable tool for developers working on AI
        projects in PHP.
