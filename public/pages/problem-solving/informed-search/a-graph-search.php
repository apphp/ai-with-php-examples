    <p>
        A* Graph Search is an enhancement of the A* Tree Search algorithm, designed to optimize its efficiency by addressing a key limitation: the
        re-exploration of nodes. In tree search, the same node can be expanded multiple times across different branches, wasting time and
        computational resources.
        <br><br>
        A* Graph Search mitigates this issue by introducing a critical rule: a node is not expanded more than once. This improvement allows the
        algorithm to explore paths more efficiently while retaining the benefits of A*â€™s heuristic-based approach.
