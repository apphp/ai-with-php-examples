    <p>
        Greedy search is an informed search algorithm that aims to expand the node closest to the goal, as estimated by a heuristic function . It
        takes a direct and straightforward approach, always choosing the path that seems most promising based on the heuristic value. The method is
        inspired by human intuition â€” choosing the option that appears best at each step without considering the overall problem structure. While
        simple and often efficient, greedy search is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
