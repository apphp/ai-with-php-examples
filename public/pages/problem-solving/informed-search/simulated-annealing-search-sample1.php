    <p>
        Simulated Annealing (SA) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where materials are heated and slowly
        cooled to reach a stable state with minimal energy. It is used to find approximate solutions to optimization problems by iteratively exploring
        potential solutions and occasionally accepting worse solutions to escape local optima.
        <br>
        The goal in this example here is to find the minimum point of $f(x) = xÂ²$, which is clearly at $x = 0$, where the function value is also $0$.
