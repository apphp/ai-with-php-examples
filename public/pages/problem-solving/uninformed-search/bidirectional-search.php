    <p>
        Bidirectional Search (BDS) is an efficient graph traversal algorithm that conducts two simultaneous searches: one starting from the initial
        state (forward search) and the other from the goal state (backward search). These searches progress until their respective search trees
        intersect, signaling that a solution path has been found. By effectively replacing a single large search space with two smaller subgraphs, BDS
        minimizes the computational overhead, making it an attractive option for navigating vast graphs.
